Mockup 0.0.1.4
-------

**Adds:**

* Traps, both unguided and guided.
* Drones.  Probably not balanced yet.
* Swarm (battleship drones).
* Manager (lvl. 10, no invisibility), Overseer, Overlord, Cruiser, Battleship, Carrier, Trap Guard, Double Trap Guard, Gunner, Rifle, Hybrid, Flamethrower, and nine(??) unnamed tanks.  Probably some more I missed, too.

**Balances:**

* Rebalanced polygons, esp. Pentagon shields.
* Nerfed/redesigned Blaster.
* Increased Triplet, Dual, and Quintuplet's FOV slightly.
* Seriously decreased Assassin's recoil.  I have no clue what that was supposed to be.
* Changed Sniper gunline's bonuses out of damage and health and into natural resistance.
* Increased Twin and Destroyer gunlines' recoil.
* Shifted around a lot of penetration bonuses.
* Decreased Machine Gun gunline's natural resist and reload.
* Buffed Gunner gunline's raw damage and resist.
* Slightly buffed Flank Guard gunline's reload and damage.
* Slightly buffed Hunter and Predator's damage.  Decreased reload.  Tightened up Predator firing timing.  Decreased bullet size.
* Made Power Gunner bullets heavier.

**Changes:**

* Renamed Bullet Strength to Bullet Health.
* Levels 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 now only give one skillpoint (used to be 2).
* Improved differentiation between Bullet Strength (now Bullet Health) and Bullet Penetration skills
* Increased agility, especially at high levels.
* Slightly increased all recoil.
* Made it easier to shoot through shields.
* Changed health bar colors.
* Lengthened the Sniper and Destroyer gunlines' barrels.
* Changed Sprayer's barrel shape to look more traditional.
* Restored Flank Guard's name. Named Sprayer, Splasher, and Tornado. Fixed some other names, see Bug Fixes below.

**Change Details:**

* Changed healthtype ratio to be proportional.
* Changed damage script to independently calculate healthtype ratio and applied penetration values to them.
* Shifted some things around under the hood with how resistance stats are handled.
* Moved bullet resistance increase from Bullet Health to Bullet Penetration.
* Changed basically everyhing about resistance actually. (NOTE TO SELF: be careful when porting changes to web version)
* Bullet Speed skills no longer improve bullet penetration, now only Bullet Penetration skills do.
* Penetration decreases glancing hit damage reduction.
* Penetration mutually accelerates collision damage.
* Bullet Health no longer directly increases bullet density (and thus mass and thus knockback).
* Bullets decrease in density with increasing player size.
* Bullets slightly increase in damage and health with increasing player health.
* Collision elasticity is now determined by the arctangent of a proportional combination of entity penetrations rather than the arctangent of a square combination.
* Entity penetration no longer directly reduces knockback.
* Entity resistance no longer directly decreases damage taken to the health.
* Increased body friction.
* Body acceleration now decreases with the fourth root of body size, not the square root.
* Doubled basic barrel recoil.
* Changed shield cohesion curve to make it more permeable at higher %s.
* Significantly nerfed polygon body damage and buffed polygon max health across the board.
* Decreased all polygon resists by 15% resist.  Squares now have 0% resist.
* Skill leak now only 0.2 instead of 0.3.
* Make skill leak up and down curves more gentle (ratios raised to the power of 1.5 instead of squared).
* Bullet Health no longer directly decreases damage.
* Decreased alpha and beta pentagon shield recharge and increased shield capacity.
* Density no longer decreases drag by default. This most affects high-level pentagons suffering severe knockback from bullet spammers.
* Maxed Bullet Penetration now gives 3 times as much penetration (used to be x2).
* Changed Bullet Health skillcurve to exponential instead of linear.
* Made the collision acceleration factor not apply to inertia.
* Made collision depth not apply to elastic inertia.
* Changed the way shield level affects acceleration from collisions.

**Fixes:**

* [!!!] Identified and fixed bug which failed to reduce elastic impulse with penetration (I had commented it out and forgot about it).
* [!!!] Identified and fixed bug where shield coherence failed to reduce knockback (same thing, I forgot I commented it out smh).
* Identified a flaw in elasticity calculations where it sometimes came up with half the elastic impulse it ought to.
* Identified a flaw in collisions calculations where it often imparted only half the appropriate acceleration.
* Fixed damage resistance factor being applied in the wrong place in damage calculations, leading to some collisions that only pushed things around, not doing any damage
* Identified and fixed bug which failed to apply hooke field impulse upon collision.
* Made skillpoint text not change color when body damage is maxed out.
* Fixed missing Predator and Gatling names.
* Fixed Death Star upgrade path from Destroyer.

**Known Bugs/Things That Aren't Going To Change In The Mockup:**

* Drones can be really bouncy against each other.  I'm not sure how to fix it; we'll call this one a known bug until I can figure out some better way to handle drone-to-drone collisions.
* Traps, on the other hand, don't interact.
* Reload timing gets messed up with upgrades and skill changes.  This is already fixed in the web version.
* No room borders.  This is already in the web version.
* Text rendering/graphics are blocky and ugly.  This is already fixed in the web version.
* Trapezoid/traps have wonky borders.  This is already fixed in the web version.
* In the upgrade menu large tanks can be clipped.  This is already fixed in the web version.

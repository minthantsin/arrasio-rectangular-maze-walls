    <li>Patched an internal bug. Moved away from activation being related to player tanks and to it being bound solely to views.</li>
    <li>Fixed a polygon spawning bug.</li>
</ul><hr><br>
<b>PATCH 2018.01.02.01</b><ul>
    <li>Our main game server js file just passed 5000 lines. Eh.</li>
    <li>4TDM time!</li>
    <li>Added a new theme.</li>
    <li>Max-stat-meta time. Same number of upgrade points but a lot fewer places to spend them. This is an experiment, and it is temporary. Please give lots of feedback about what you think! If you put your thoughts on the reddit or discord I'll see them.</li>
    <li>Re-enabled AI.</li>
    <li>Re-enabled the minimap.</li>
    <li>Reduced damage a bit more.</li>
    <li>Doubled glass health and shield without affecting maxed out health and shield.</li>
    <li>Added Gravel. (Smaller Rocks)</li>
    <br>
    <li>Reshaped Machine Gunner. (Thanks to Fillygroove for the inspiration!)</li>
    <li>Reshaped Bent Double. Its barrels are more seperated than the normal Bent.</li>
    <li>Souped up Auto-Smasher's guns a lot.</li>
    <li>Increased Hunters' knockback and decreased bullet damage by 6%.</li>
    <li>Nerfed Sidewinder damage by 5% on top of the Hunter nerf.</li>
    <li>Slightly nerfed minion bullet speed. Nerfed minion health by 20%.</li>
    <li>Nerfed Destroyers.</li>
    <li>Nerfed swarm but gave it a bit more speed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Simplified AI to cheapen processing but also to stop drones from getting overly attached to their nearest rock. I did this by disabling the AI behavior that told it to start fighting whatever had tried to hurt it. Beacuse of this, Auto-turrets won't cancel everything and start fighting somebody who shot at you and Factory minions won't auto-target things they run into while shooing at something else. However, disabling this should also keep drones from skynetting after you as long as you are shooting at them. (Previously, they'd keep agressing as long as they were being hurt despite being far from their parent. If you didn't shoot at them, they'd relent.)</li>
    <li>Tweaked some network config settings.</li>
    <li>More server profiling work.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with disappearing names on tanks with auto-spin.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that made things laggier than it should be for few people.</li>
    <li>Experimenting with dynamically loading entities into the collision grid. Not sure what the optimal case for this is so it may be a slowdown or a speedup. We'll see. Also modified how we reload entities into the collision grid. Should be more efficient.</li>
    <li>Changed how food moves. Hopefully should act mostly the same but be 5 times less intensive.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Added Paypal link and changed the Patreon link.</li>
    <li>Fixed and improved the ignore upgrade button.</li>
    <li>Started using -webkit-text-security to style the token input. It won't fuss about security issues any more but it also won't hide your token on Firefox or IE. You win some, you lose some.</li>
    <li>Happy 2018, everybody! Thanks for all the love ❤<br>-neph</li>
</ul><hr><br>
<b>PATCH 2017.12.29.03</b><ul>
    <li>Changed how wall bounce is calculated for better trickshots :)</li>
    <li>More server profiling work.</li>
    <li>Tried to buff rammers.</li>
</ul><hr><br>
<b>PATCH 2017.12.29.02</b><ul>
    <li>More backend tweaks.</li>
    <li>Added ignore upgrade button and fixed right-clicking on buttons.</li>
    <li>Buffed minion speed and minion bullet speed.</li>
</ul><hr><br>
<b>PATCH 2017.12.29.01</b><ul>
    <li>Nerfed Cruiser kinda.</li>
    <li>Buffed over-drones' speed and spawn rate. Nerfed their health. Made Director shoot over-drones not just raw drones.</li>
    <li>Reshaped many of the drone classes.</li>
    <li>Some sniper-branch nerfs. 20% less damage, 10% faster rof, and a bit more bullet speed to compensate.</li>
    <li>Buffed Predator.</li>
    <li>Really rethought how we serve updates to people. Might be faster! Might not be. Who knows? Will likely be buggy at first though.</li>
</ul><hr><br>
<b>PATCH 2017.12.28.02</b><ul>
    <li>Decreased swarm damage by a lot. Sped it up somewhat to compensate.</li>
    <li>Reduced skimmer missile cannon recoil.</li>
    <li>More backend tweaks.</li>
</ul><hr><br>
<b>PATCH 2017.12.28.01</b><ul>
    <li>Changed the map again.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Increased all weapon damage by 50% and lowered all weapon health by 33%. 1.5 x 0.6667 = 1 for those of you who intend to raise a fuss but can't do math.</li>
    <li>Also decreased drone and bullet pushability.</li>
    <li>Increased base tank speed and acceleration.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Added additional profiling tools. There is no difference for you guys but it lets me figure out why Newark is so slow.</li>
    <li>Disabled the minimap. (Temporary)</li>
    <li>Disabled all targeting AI. (Temporary) This shuts off automatic drone behavior and auto-turrets as well as probably some other stuff I forgot relied on it. This is a major change but, again, it is only temporary. I'm curious just how much of a load the AI calculations have on the server. If it seems significant I'll look at ways I can improve it.</li>
    <li>Various other tweaks to reduce server load. I don't expect it'll have much effect.</li>
    <li>Major backend changes to the server and source processing and deployment pipeline. Should be smarter about caching and versioning.</li>
</ul><hr><br>
<b>PATCH 2017.12.27.01</b><ul>
    <li>Improved fonts.</li>
    <li>Terrain fixes and modifications. Bullets now ricochet off of walls. Trickshot time!</li>

<b>PATCH 2017.12.26.01</b><ul>
    <li>2TDM time.</li>
    <li>Decreased Damage across the board.</li>
    <li>Added a class (last one I swear: because Rocketeer was added I figured I ought to just release Sidewinder already):<ul>
        <li>Hunter => Sidewinder</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Significantly changed Boomer and slightly changed Skimmer.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Severly nerfed swarm speed. Really rolled back on the penetration buff. Significantly increased health. Made it decay faster when not being manually controlled: this also means that the autoswarm of battleship has half range compared to previously... compensated for this by making it a bit faster than normal swarm.</li>
    <li>Decreased Assassins' bullet damage.</li>
    <li>Slowed down auto-drones' spawn speed.</li>
    <li>Reduced Auto-4's range.</li>

    <br>
    <li>Fixed the bugged Overgunner recoil.</li> 
    <li>Went back to the old spike design. We'll keep the new design in mind for a future smasher.</li>

    <li>Stopped polygons from spawning on top of you.</li>
    <li>Some major under-the-hood changes to collision mechanics and recoil.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Optimized some rendering stuff.</li>
    <li>Improved some animations.</li>
    <li>Made the server smarter about ignoring distant food entities.</li>

    <li><b>Known Bugs:</b></li><ul>
        <li>While entities grow to full size, their speed is bugged. Thanks to this bug, Necro can obtain unreasonably fast drones and for this reason it has been removed until I have time to fix the problem. Additionally, if you do not move after spawning, you have abnormally high recoil. This I don't think is enough of an issue to require an immediate fix. I'm about 82% sure it's the same bug, though.</li>
        <li>Dying entities can move weirdly. The cause of this bug is known.</li>
        <li>Often, the client won't connect properly. Known cause, just keep reloading until it works, for now.</li>
        <li>No death screen. Unknown cause, but I'm not going to bother fixing it now because I want to add proper enter-to-respawn soon and I'll catch this problem while adding that feature.</li>
        <li>Canvas doesn't always seems to obtain context properly on game start.</li>
        <li>Tap-shooting doesn't register with high latency. Known cause.</li>
        <li>Bullets often draw on top of things they couldn't. Known cause, but the fix will be part of adding better layering functionality.</li>
        <li>Often entities flash twice on taking damage.</li>
        <li>Messages don't work.</li>

    <li>Decreased Hybrid-type drones' top speed by 20%.</li>
    <li>Removed high-recoil flag from Tri-Angle-type rear barrels. Removed low-recoil flat from Tri-Angle-type front barrels.</li>
    <li>Increased necro drone health by 50%. Increased automatic reload by 100% (fires half as fast).</li>
    <li>Halved twin recoil.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Doubled the natural effect of all recoil.</li>
    <li>Quartered base gun recoil.</li>
    <li>Changed the way recoil is calculated in the physics. Should make high-recoil tanks more recoily and low-recoil tanks less so, also dimished the importance of Bullet Speed in recoil calculations.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Invuln breaks upon user disconnect now.</li>
    <li>The only valid targets for targeting AI (bots, auto-turrets, some kinds of drones) are tanks, food, and crashers now.</li>
